  I want to be really awesome at programming and not just coding. Basically a
  true engineer with the problem solving skills. This course is just one of the
  many steps I am taking.

<p>
  And I don't just want to learn Web Development. I want to be if not better
  than as good as a mobile app developer as well and for that I am learning the
  Flutter framework with firebase as backend.
